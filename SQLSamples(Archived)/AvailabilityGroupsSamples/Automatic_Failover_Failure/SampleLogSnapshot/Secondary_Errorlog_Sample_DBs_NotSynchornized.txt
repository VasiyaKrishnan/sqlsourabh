2017-10-25 01:24:08.81 spid62s     The state of the local availability replica in availability group 'LeaseTimeout' has changed from 'SECONDARY_NORMAL' to 'RESOLVING_NORMAL'.  The state changed because the availability group state has changed in Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC).  For more information, see the SQL Server error log or cluster log.  If this is a Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) availability group, you can also see the WSFC management console.

2017-10-25 01:24:08.98 spid73      The availability replica for availability group 'LeaseTimeout' on this instance of SQL Server cannot become the primary replica. One or more databases are not synchronized or have not joined the availability group. If the availability replica uses the asynchronous-commit mode, consider performing a forced manual failover (with possible data loss). Otherwise, once all local secondary databases are joined and synchronized, you can perform a planned manual failover to this secondary replica (without data loss).
